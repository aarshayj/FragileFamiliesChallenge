# Impact of Absent Father on Childâ€™s Education 
Columbia University Applied Mathematics (APMAE4990) Modeling Social Data Class Project

This study used the [FragileFamiliesChallenge](http://fragilefamilieschallenge.org/) data to determine the impact of biological father's involvement up to the age of 9 years on educational outcome (GPA) at the age of 15 years.

Please refer the following files for details of the work done:

1. Final Report
  - This is present in the **Final_Report.pdf** document

2. Code to reproduce the results
  - Both Python and R were used to do the analysis. The sequence of codes to run are:
    1. **data_preparation.py | data_preparation.ipynb** : These will read the data from raw files and create a new data_final.csv file. The jupyter notebook has clear instructions to run the code.

    2. **exploration_analysis.Rmd** : This R notebook has all the analysis and charts reported finally. The codes can be run to reconfirm. An html versino "exporation_analysis.html" has also been provided for easy reading.

3. Data Dictionary:
  - Another contribution to the project was a data dictionary of the 600 constructed variables. 
  - This is present in **FFC_Data_Dictionary.xlsx** which is a MS Excel file with clear instructions on how to read the dictionary.

4. Final Presentation
  - The final deck presented is available in the **Final_Presentation.pdf** file.

*Important Note:*
The FFChallenge folder should have the data which came from the zip file shared by the FFChallenge organizers.
